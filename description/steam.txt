[h1] SUPPORT 1.11.* (PEACOCK) [/h1]

[h1] Introdution [/h1]

Ever thought it is a bit ridiculous how House Unity changes the same amount in a 3-member House and a 300-member House? Or how demanding the Aged Cheese and the Ark of the Covenant decrease House Unity and opinion by the same amount [i] (don't give me wrong, cheese is great)[/i]? Well this mod has you covered.

At its core, it uses dynamic scaling to adjust any House Unity changes depending on the number of landed rulers in that House (capped to 25%). For a more detailed overview of all its features, see the list below. If you would like to suggest any new features, report any bugs (including incompatibility with other mods) or provide localization, please use either the comment section or preferably [url=https://github.com/my4ng/house-unity-balanced] GitHub Issue [/url].

[h1] Compatibility [/h1]

This mod modifies a considerable number of files, most importantly [b] 00_unity_values.txt [/b] in order to enable dynamic House Unity Scaling. As a result, any reference to [b] *_unity_value/gain/loss [/b] by itself and outside of effects such as [b] apply_clan_unity_interaction_effect [/b] must be wrapped in the appropriate House scope. It should be placed above other mods that use the House Unity mechanic in the load order.
